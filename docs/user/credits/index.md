## Edit Credits

To edit the credits, they must first be displayed. Either click "credits" at the bottom-left or bottom-right of the page and then click on the contents of the credits. Alternatively just press the `c` key to achieve the same result.

At the righthand side of the magazine tool a text field to edit the contents will now appear.
