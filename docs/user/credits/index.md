# Credits
<!-- [[TOC]] -->
This page outlines how to edit the credit elements found on most pages of the magazine in the lower-left or lower-right hand corners of the page.

## Positioning

The credits can appear on either side of the page. To switch between the left and right, click the arrows key, next to the word Credits.

## Colour

The credits are also able to appear in either black or white. To switch between the two click the black and white circle button. 

## Show/Hide

To completely remove the credits from a page, or to add credits to a page that does not have them, click the eye icon.

## Edit Credits

To edit the credits, they must first be displayed. Either click on the "credits" button at the bottom-left or bottom-right of the page and then click on the content of the credits. Alternatively just press the "c" key to acheive the same result.

At the righthand side of the magazine tool the content of the credits should be displayed.
