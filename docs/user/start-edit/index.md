# Start Editing
<!-- [[TOC]] -->
While on staging on a specific page of the magaziner, click the MagTool bookmark in your browser's bookmarks bar to load the Magazine Tool. Once the Magazine Tool has loaded click "Start Edit".


## Unlock

If the page is locked that will usually mean someone else has recently been trying to edit the magazine. Check on Trello to see if anybody else is editing the same page. If you're certain that you're the only editor, click "Unlock" then "Start Edit" again.
