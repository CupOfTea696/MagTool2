## Editing Text Content

To start editing the content of a text-box, double click it. The MagTool will go into text-editing mode and automatically select all the text for you. To deslect all the text click anywhere in the text-box. Once you are done, click outside of the text-box and it will leave editing mode.

## Align Text

You can align text to the left, right or middle just like in many other text editing applications. The controls for these can be found in the right-hand-side of the MagTool once a text-box has been selected.

## Change Colour

You can change a text to be black or white depending on the background that the text-block sits on. The controls for these can be found in the right-hand-side of the MagTool once a text-box has been selected.

## Selection Changes

When you are in editing mode you can select pieces of text and apply changes to your selections. These changes are detailed below. Sometimes you will not be able to apply the changes you are trying to for a certain type of text-block. This depends on whether or not that change is typically used on that type of text-box in previous issues. Any changes you make with the text-editor can be under using `ctrl+z`.

### Bold, Italics & Underline

Press the `B` button to make text bold. Press the `I` button to make text Italic. Press the `U` button to give text an underline.

### Links

Press the `#` button to make the selected text a link. You will then be prompted for the URL of the link. Be sure that the link you insert has the prefix "http://" or "https://". You can the select the "open in new window" option to make the link open in a new tab.

### Headings

Certain types of text-boxes have header styles associated with them. For example in the list, the main article text-boxes have headers such as "HOW TO MAKE IT WORK FOR WORK". To turn a selection of text into one of these headers use the corresponding `H` button.

### Capitalise

Use the `Aa` button to capitalise a selection of text.
