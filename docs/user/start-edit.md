## Start Edit

While on staging on a specific page of the Magazine, click the MagTool bookmark in your browser's bookmarks bar to load the Magazine Tool. Once the Magazine Tool has loaded click the `Start Edit` button.

## Unlock

If the page is locked that will usually mean someone else is editing the Page. Check on Trello to see if anybody else is editing the same page. If you're certain that you're the only editor, click the `Unlock` button, then click the `Start Edit` button again.
