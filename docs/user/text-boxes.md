This page outlines how to use the new text editor. To find out how to move, delete and anchor text-boxes go to the [general][general editing page].

# Start the text editor
<!-- [[TOC]] -->
To start editing the content of a text-box, double click it. The MagTool will go into text-editing mode and automatically select all the text for you. To deslect all the text click anywhere in the text-box. Once you are done, click outside of the text-box and it will leave editing mode.
