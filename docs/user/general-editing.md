# Selecting and Moving Elements
<!-- [[TOC]] -->
This page introduces the general editing abilities of the Magazine Tool. These actions are common to text-boxes, images, CTA links etc which are referred to below as elements.

## Selecting Elements

To select an element on the page click that element once. The element will be highlighted and the properties will be displayed in the right-hand-side of the Magazine Tool. You can also select multiple elements at once. To do so, either drag a box around the elements you want to select, or select them individually while holding the shift key.

## Deleting Elements

When you have selected one or more elements you can remove them from the page completely by pressing the backspace key.

## Moving Elements

When you have selected one or more elements you can move them around the page by dragging them. You can also use the arrow keys to move them by one grid position. If you hold shift and use the arrow keys the element/s will move by 4 grid positions.

## Anchors

Anchors determine which side (top/bottom and left/right) of the element determines it's position. For example, if you set the anchor of a text element to be on the right, then increase the width of that element, the left-hand-side will stretch across the page and the right-hand-side (the anchor point) will stay still.

This behaviour is particularily useful when aligning text-boxes. If the tops of two text-boxes are supposed to line up perfectly, set both their anchors to be at the top and then reposition them so that they line up.
