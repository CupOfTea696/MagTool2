# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Developer Documentation. Here you'll find any information you need on developing the Magazine Tool. This includes in-depth explanations on how things work as well as guides on how to run a local version, build and distribute new versions of the tool. Feel like something is missing, or found a typo? Go [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NAPWebProductionEditTeam/MagTool2/issues) and we'll try our best to update the Documentation as soon as possible. Any bugs you found can be [reported there](https://github.com/NAPWebProductionEditTeam/MagTool2/issues) as well.

Happy Hacking!
