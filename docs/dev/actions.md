# Actions
<!-- [[TOC]] -->

## Background

Actions are a command or set of commands that can be triggered by the user through various user interactions. They MUST be defined in the [Application Core][docs.application]. Actions are also aware of when they can be triggered. Depending on their definition, actions can be limited to only work in Edit Mode or View Mode. Actions can only be resolved inside the Application Core, and therefore any bindings MUST be defined in the Application Core as well.
