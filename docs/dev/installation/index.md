# Installation
<!-- [[TOC]] -->

## Prerequisites

To get started on developing on the Magazine Tool, you'll need a few things. First off you'll need [Git][git], [Node.js][node-js] and [npm][npm] installed. If you don't have those yet, just follow the links and the installation instructions should be on their respective websites. Next, you need [bower][bower] and [Grunt][grunt] installed as well. To do so, run `npm install -g bower` and `npm install -g grunt-cli` in your command-line.

## Installation

Now that you have all required software setup on your system, you can go ahead and clone the [repo][repo] using `git clone https://github.com/NAPWebProductionEditTeam/MagTool2`. Next, install your dependencies by running `npm install` and `bower install` in your project folder. Once that is done, you can keep your dependencies up-to-date by running `grunt update`.
