# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Developer Documentation. Here you'll find any information you need on developing the Magazine Tool. This includes in-depth explanations on how things work as well as guides on how to run a local version, build and distribute new versions of the tool. Feel like something is missing, or found a typo? Go [open an issue on GitHub][issues] and we'll try our best to update the Documentation as soon as possible. Any bugs you found can be [reported there][issues] as well.

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][rfc_2119].

Happy Hacking!
